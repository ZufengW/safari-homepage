# safari-homepage
Simple home page. It has one image and a "do it" caption. The image is picked randomly from a list.

Based on my current Safari home page (as of Oct 2017). It has less text and other things compared to my previous one.

## Usage instructions
Download everything and put it all in one place. Open index.html with your web browser.

Add more images by putting them in the `images` folder and adding their file names to the list in `index.html`.
